				<h3>EduSync</h3>
				<p>EduSync is a sync service provided to the education sector that syncs data between the Management Information System (MIS) of a school or college and Microsoft Office365. Once the properties are synced, they are available on the Microsoft Graph API for education users and tenants. The tech stack used involved Laravel, Powershell, 3rd Party APIs and Cron jobs set up to run on Azure. EduSync is one of the sync services featured on the <a href="http://sds.microsoft.com" class="site">Microsoft School Data Sync website.</a></p>

				<h3>EduBoard - Backend</h3>
				<p>EduBoard integrates with numerous APIs, both external and it's own internal API. The data analytics that sits behind the student dashboard uses Microsoft's Power BI to provide schools and colleges with a deeper insight into key areas of their establishment. Hosted on Azure, using SQL databases with an App Service allows the application to scale. </p>

				<h3>Student Tracking System</h3>
				<p>An enterprise level application which is used for analysis and reporting on a number of topics related to courses run by the University. My task was to implement the dynamic generation of student timetables which would then be emailed to each student individually. Developed with the PHP MVC framework CodeIgniter, this feature relied heavily on efficient MySQL queries.</p>

				<h3>Voucher and Discount Codes</h3>
